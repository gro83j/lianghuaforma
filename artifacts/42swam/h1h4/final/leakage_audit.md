# Leakage Audit

## Alignment Strategy
- H1 features aligned to last closed H1 bar before entry_time; if entry_time is on the hour, use prior hour.
- H4 features aligned to last closed H4 bar before entry_time; if entry_time is on a 4h boundary, use prior bar.

## Summary
| feature_type | violation_count | max_violation_seconds | sample_entries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | 0 | 0.0 |  |
| H4 | 0 | 0.0 |  |
